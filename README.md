# ToDo-API-Controller

This is a simple API for a small to-do list application.

It is built using the ASP.NET Core 8 framework and uses Entity Framework Core for database interaction/persistence.

It manipulates a single model, Item, using the HTTP verbs GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE.

It uses traditional API controllers, with majority of the 'important' API code living in the ItemController.cs class.

I am developing a functionally identical API using MinimalAPI controllers at the same time.
